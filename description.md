# 3. MLDP
- This project aims to predict whether a car insurance policyholder is likely to file a claim within the next 6 months, helping insurance companies improve decision-making, risk assessment, and operational efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- **🎯 Objective**: Build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a policyholder filing a car insurance claim within 6 months.
- **📊 Dataset**: Contains detailed information about policyholders and their car insurance policies. The target variable `Is_Claim` is binary (1 = Claimed, 0 = Not Claimed).
- **💡 Business Impact**: Supports insurers in setting accurate premiums, detecting high-risk customers, and optimizing claim processing workflows.
- **🧠 Approach**: Applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to maximize predictive accuracy.
- **📈 Outcome**: The final model enables proactive risk management and enhances customer satisfaction by tailoring policies more effectively.

# 4. Network-Intrusion-Detection
- This project leverages the CICIDS 2017 dataset to develop an anomaly detection model that identifies malicious network activity, enhancing cybersecurity defenses.

## 📌 Overview & Use Case

- **📚 Dataset**: Utilizes the CICIDS 2017 dataset, specifically Thursday morning’s traffic, which includes both normal and web-based attacks like Brute Force, SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting.
- **🎯 Objective**: Build a machine learning model to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious to detect intrusions effectively in real-time.
- **📈 Features**: Includes detailed flow-based attributes such as timestamps, source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and labeled attack types.
- **🔍 Use Case**: Strengthen network security by implementing a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of identifying cyber threats in diverse traffic patterns.
- **🧠 Outcome**: The resulting model aids in proactive threat mitigation and helps network administrators respond swiftly to potential attacks.
